12. Very difficult - had to Google the answer.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT m.title, a.name
FROM (SELECT movie.*
      FROM movie
      JOIN casting
      ON casting.movieid = movie.id
      JOIN actor
      ON actor.id = casting.actorid
      WHERE actor.name = 'Julie Andrews') AS m
JOIN (SELECT actor.*, casting.movieid AS movieid
      FROM actor
      JOIN casting
      ON casting.actorid = actor.id
      WHERE casting.ord = 1) as a
ON m.id = a.movieid
ORDER BY m.title;
```

13.
```sql
SELECT name
FROM actor JOIN casting ON actor.id = casting.actorid
WHERE ord = 1
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 15;
```

14.
```sql

GROUP BY title
ORDER BY actors DESC, title;
```

15.

actor.name = 'Art Garfunkel') AND actor.name != 'Art Garfunkel';
```
